Racing Game

My game is meant to emulate a carnival-style horse race. I aimed to move several horses across the screen from left to right with a function to alert the players when someone had won. The game allows the user to pick a number of players from 2-4. Each player is assigned a preset horse and a key to move that horse forward. I wanted to give the players some customization, so I used an object constructor to collect users' names and also keep track of scores.
