-Choose number of players, up to 4
  //Make it possible for players to be computer controlled
-Choose music from Spotify API
-Choose the color of your horse
-Music that plays when someone wins

** Need to add a constructor of some sort

Racing Game
My game is meant to emulate a carnival-style horse race. I aimed to move several horses across the screen from left to right with a function to alert the players when someone had won. I wanted to give the players some customization over their horse, so I wrote an object constructor that created player objects and used the player-generated information throughout the game.

Technologies Used:
-Html
-Css
-Javascript
-Bootstrap
-jQuery
-Handlebars
-Photoshop

Existing Features:
-Customization of player avatar
-Keypress UI to move avatar from left to right
-Alert who won
-Music customization available through Spotify API
-Loop-based countdown timer that counts 3-2-1 until players start
-Win counter

Planned Features:
-Obstacles for horses to "jump" over
-Use GIFs as avatars so it looks like the horses are running
