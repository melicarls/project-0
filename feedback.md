**Your project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:**

* **Technical Requirements**: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements?

Your first project was a success!  You wrote thoughtful, well-designed code that is rock solid.  I'd like to challenge you to extract the repetitious code blocks (similar blocks for each player) into functions and call each function  with unique player params to make your code more DRY and scalable (80 players?!).  Your code could also use some OOP to make Players and your Game more modular.

* **Creativity**: Did you add a personal spin or creative element to your project? Did you deliver something of value to the end user?

The idea to make a horse racing game is completely original. I have never seen this game at GA yet.  Great 'trotting' animation and wonderful addition of sound and win conditions.

* **Code Quality**: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

You broke code into manageable chunks and paid attention to edge cases and the added challenge of having multiple player counts.  Your indentation, syntax, naming convention, and style were great.  For modularity, I'd like to see more functions refactored from your more 'epic' code blocks.  This would make your code more reusable, scalable, and downright elegant.

* **Problem Solving**: Are you able to defend why you implemented your solution in a certain way? Can you demonstrate that you thought through alternative implementations?

Your game options (names, number of players, sprite movement) all came with their own unique challenges and gotchas; you have tackled each with great solutions.  After working with JQuery and event listeners for over a week longer than when this was assigned, I'd love to see what awesome  code you would create with a refactor.  Great job!
